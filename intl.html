		<h3>Steven Black's INTL Toolkit is hassle-free</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="col-md-6">
		<p><strong>INTL is a snap to integrate</strong> into new and existing applications. Simply do the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Create an INTL object early in the application's startup</li>

			<li>Add a line to your baseform <code>INIT()</code> to message INTL</li>

			<li>Make GENMENUX your menu generator</li>

			<li>Build your application</li>

			<li>Voil√†, you are basically done and ready to give a very credible demo to your boss or
			customer!&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<p><strong>INTL helps with finish and polish</strong> issues like:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>See <a href="/downloads/">Downloads</a> for <strong>GOTCHAS</strong>, a
			utillity that audits your project for instances of the known issues.</li>
			<li>My <a href="/intl-vfp/">VFP International Issues page</a> discusses the no-nos you may
			have coded in your application.</li>

			<li>Expunge hard-coded messages from your applcation. See <a
			href="/downloads/">Downloads</a> for a <strong>public-domain version of MsgSvc</strong> to see how that
			works.</li>

		<h3>INTL retrofits easily into new and existing apps.</h3>

		<p>INTL is a great component. It is both a complete black box you can use immediately, and also a highly
		hooked and extendible component that you can tailor, extend, or subclass as you need.</p>

		<p>INTL is a great component because:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>it comes with full annotated source code.</li>

			<li>it is tuned for each version of VFP for maximum performance.</li>

			<li>it has great documentation.</li>

			<li>its classes are explicitly named for the design patterns it used so functionality is easily
			unerstood.</li>

			<li>it provides hooks for every action so you can easily change default behavior.</li>

			<li>it provides a number of specialized localization strategies that you can add on for particular
			locales. For example, you would use the right-to-Left strategy to localize for the Middle East and the
			Orient, or add in the multi-currency strategy on forms displaying financial data.</li>

			<li>you can localize strings, fonts, images, data sources, as required, with easy to configure add-in
			strategies for each.</li>

		<h3>INTL is high-quality source code</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>"...the source code itself is a treasure. I get to see a
			lot of source, and Steven's is among the best I've seen."</p>

			<p class="pull-right">Whil Hentzen, Editor, FoxTalk Magazine</p>
		</blockquote>

	    <p>Steven Black's INTL Toolkit is a great example of literate programming. It is designed
	    in such a way as to teach you the maximum about itself, and also about FoxPro.</p>

	    <p>Much of INTL's architecture is named explicitly after the design patterns it emulates.
	    The result is a black box tool that'll easily become a white box in the unlikely event you need to change
	    it to your particular circumstances.</p>
